NightWatch
==========

A five-person game project from Freshman Year (February 2013 - May 2013).

The game NightWatch was a student-made project for the class Game Software Development III. The game was designed to
be an isometric mystery/puzzle game where the player navigates through a mansion to try and escape the clutches of a mysterious monster.
In addition, we had intended to implement multiple endings for the game. The game was intended to be vastly 
different from what was to be expected from a ten-week Freshman-made game by focusing on story, atmosphere, puzzles, and 
tension as opposed to basic mechanics and simple gameplay.

Though we received an A on the assignment, the game was largely incomplete at the time of submission. The final submission was practically 
a complete failure. It wasn't the latest edition to the game due to our complete lack of version control. Roughly half of what we had 
initially intended to deliver was implemented. Most of our puzzles had not been implemented, we had no ending let alone two, and we had no
monster mechanic yet. We had basic user controllability, collisions, a map-editor, the story and dialog, most of the art and some animations, 
and room-to-room navigation completed.

I contributed to this game the ability to pick items up, and add the collectable journal entries to the journal. I worked on the inventory system,
the clock/watch mechanic, and the one implemented time puzzle.

This game, while one of my darkest memories, taught me some of the most important lessons about game design. Version control become one of my highest
priorities for any project. I swore the death of over-scoping, or at least to that extent. I also learned that I needed to do more, during this project,
while I had many contributions, they were only what I had asked to do or what I had been assigned to do. During some of the most difficult moments I never
dove into doing more. After this project everything I ever worked on, I became one of the highest contributors.
